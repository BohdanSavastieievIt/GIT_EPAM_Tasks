Dark as roses, and fine as sand
I feel your healing and your sting again
I hear you laughing and my soul is saved
On forgotten graves you cry

Crawl like ivy up my spine
Through my nerves and into my eyes
Cuts like anguish or
Recollections of better days gone by

But it's alright
When you're all in pain
And you feel the rain come down
Oh, it's alright
When you find your way
Then you see it disappear
Oh, it's alright
Though your garden's grey
I know all your graces
Someday will flower
Woawoa Woawoa
In a sweet sunshower
In a sweet sunshower
